# Muckrock 50-a FOIL request status

This readme is still really rough. Let's improve it together â˜†

## Datastore setup

**Official way (22+ minute wait time)**

```shell
cd server
npm i
npm run datastore:init
```

See the readme in [the `server` directory](./server/readme.md) for details on what the datastore scripts do.

**Cheating**

Ok, so you don't want to wait that long! You can do this instead:

```shell
cd server
mkdir src/datastore/data
cp src/datastore/referenceData/fullDatastore-NNNNNNNNNNNN.json src/datastore/data/NNNNNNNNNNNN.json # The file rename is important
```

This mimicks what the `npm run datastore:init` script will do, but with reference data already stored within the repo.

## Server setup

```shell
cd server
npm i # If you didn't already do this when setting up the datastore
npm run dev
```

Serves on port `3000`.

Try it by sending a GET request to `localhost:3000/v1/latest`

## Browser app setup

```shell
cd browser
npm i
npm start
```

When prompted about ports, enter "Yes".

Serves on port `3001`.

Try it by navigating your browser to `localhost:3001`.
