# Scraper

## Usage

### Running the script

```
npm start         # Run scraper (run time: 22+ minutes)
npm run debug     # Run scraper in debug mode (run time: < 1 minute)
```

Debug mode will:

- Show browser UI in case you need to debug the scraper
- Only pull a very small sampling of the total data a full script run would pull, shorting your wait time

### Getting output

Output is written to `./output`.
